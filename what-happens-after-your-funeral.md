##### 17. In the coming months, your close relationships will return to the cinema and the beach.
##### 18. Everybodyâ€™s life will go back to normal. Just as there is no difference between a withered leaf of a big tree and what you live and die for, it all happens so easily, so fast, without any movement.
##### 19. Started raining, the election is coming, the crowds on the buses are as usual, an actress is getting married, the festival is coming, the World Cup cricket is going as planned, the flowers are in full bloom, and your pet gave birth to next puppy.

##### 22. In the blink of an eye Years have passed and there is no one to talk about you.
##### 23. One day, just looking at old photos, one of your close friend may remember you.  In your hometown, of the thousands of people you've become acquainted with, only one person, as you have ever been, can rarely talk to anyone about you.
##### 24. You maybe living elsewhere, as someone else, if reincarnation is true. Otherwise, you will be nothing and will be plunged into darkness for decades.

### Tell me now...
People are waiting to forget you easily.  Then who are you running around for?  And who are you worried for?

For most part of your life, say 80%, you think about what your relatives and neighbors think about you. 

Are you living a life to satisfy them? **NO USE**

Life is once, just live it... Try to help someone in need. He will atleast remember you :heart:
