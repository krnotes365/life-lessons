# How to prepare for a recession

1. Assume you’re getting laid off.  
    You’re most likely not.  
    But sometimes this is what you need for that boost of focus to increase cash flow and inject new opportunities in your back pocket.  
    This is your wake-up call.
2. Build bridges  
    Meet 2+ new people per week for coffee  
    Ask them what they are working on  
    Project sound cool?  
    Ask them if you can help   
    Take cash or equity or tokens or a mix.   
3. Launch a business that generate $1000/month in 2022   
    Dream ridiculously big, but ok to start small    
    $1000/month is attainable   
    Do the $1000/month challenge with other friends who want to build. Will keep you accountable   
    You got this   
4. Launch a minimum viable community (MVC)   
    Community unlocks potential   
    Being a leader of a community is incredibly valuable (and fulfilling)    
    You can sell products, services or NFTS to them (for profit or non)

5. Buy a business   
    Always easier to buy over build   
    And during downturns, there are an abundance of deals worth buying   
    Step 1: find a business worth buying    
    Step 2: create a fair deal for investors   
    Step 3: dial for dollars   
6. Make the jobs to be done framework your friend   
    Too much money can make us lazy   
    The “jobs to be done framework” will keep us honest on shipping products with high likelihood of success during a recession   
7. Invest in yourself   
    A true warrior relies on him/her/their self. Its the only thing that can't be taken away   
    Sharpen your blade and it’ll gives you creative juice to ideate   
    We created Dash product challenges for product designers to hone their skills

8. Publish your work   
    Step 1: update your portfolio   
    Step 2: add you’re open to freelance work or learning about new opportunities   
9. Keep your spirits high    
    Don’t get swept into the bad energy of a downturn   
    That’s the most dangerous part    
    Your confidence is key.

1. Reduce costs as much as you can   
2. Keep spirits as high as you can
