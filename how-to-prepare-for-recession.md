# How to prepare for a recession

1. Assume you’re getting laid off.  
    You’re most likely not.  
    But sometimes this is what you need for that boost of focus to increase cash flow and inject new opportunities in your back pocket.  
    This is your wake-up call.
2. Build bridges 
    Meet 2+ new people per week for coffee 
    Ask them what they are working on 
    Project sound cool? 
    Ask them if you can help
    Take cash or equity or tokens or a mix.
3. Launch a business that generate $1000/month in 2022
    Dream ridiculously big, but ok to start small 
    $1000/month is attainable
    Do the $1000/month challenge with other friends who want to build. Will keep you accountable
    You got this
4. Launch a minimum viable community (MVC)
    Community unlocks potential
    Being a leader of a community is incredibly valuable (and fulfilling) 
    You can sell products, services or NFTS to them (for profit or non)

5. Buy a business
    Always easier to buy over build
    And during downturns, there are an abundance of deals worth buying
    Step 1: find a business worth buying 
    Step 2: create a fair deal for investors
    Step 3: dial for dollars
6. Make the jobs to be done framework your friend
    Too much money can make us lazy
    The “jobs to be done framework” will keep us honest on shipping products with high likelihood of success during a recession
